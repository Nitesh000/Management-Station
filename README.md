# Management-Station
A HRMS(Human Resource Management System) created with Node js, with me adding a little changes.
It will nedd MongoDB for back-end and for the front-end you can use any browser.
This project of a similar to HRMS system will use local mongodb as a server and database and will not required any internet connection for it.
This will eb like a locally used Human Resource Mangement System, which in this case known as Management Station.
